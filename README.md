# Solution architecture
This is a showcase of the architecture of the solutions built by me in AWS.
The solutions which are mostly serverless were built for real time projects except for the 3 tier serverless app that was built as a proof of concept to explore finegrained permissions on DynamoDB using IAM and Cognito.
