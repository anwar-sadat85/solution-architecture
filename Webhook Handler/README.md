# Webhook Handler
<p>The Lambda and API Gareway based solution was designed and implemented to integrate a digital publication platform to a headless CMS platform.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of this solution, the content authors had to login to the publishing platform to get details of the publications and then create a CMS entry manually using the details</p>
<p>This solution automatically created a CMS entry whenever a new issue was created and published in the digital publication platform.</p> 
<p>This automation helped improve the operational efficiency of the content authors and helped them publish digital issues directly to mobile apps</p>
